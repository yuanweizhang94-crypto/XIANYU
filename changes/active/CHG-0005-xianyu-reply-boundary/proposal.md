# CHG-0005 Proposal

Status: DRAFT
Change ID: CHG-0005-xianyu-reply-boundary

## Purpose

Prepare a formally reviewable boundary for selecting local fixed-script reply decisions without sending a real Xianyu message or accessing a real platform account.

## Target capability

- `CAP-XY-REPLY`

## Current authorization

This change is DRAFT only.

The project owner has authorized creation of the change proposal but has not approved T1 or implementation.

No CHG-0005 task may execute while the change remains DRAFT.

## Goals

- Define terminology for reply rules, templates, match inputs, decisions, no-match outcomes, escalation, and human transfer.
- Define how a future local fixed-script rule may consume approved local Message-boundary values.
- Define deterministic rule precedence and conflict handling.
- Define authorization, risk-control, content-safety, and fail-closed boundaries.
- Define future ownership, persistence, lifecycle, and failure questions.
- Define acceptance criteria before implementation.
- Preserve fixed rules as the first decision layer before any future AI fallback.

## Non-goals

- No real Xianyu message sending.
- No automatic reply delivery.
- No real account access.
- No real customer data.
- No Cookie, Token, Secret, Session Material, or browser Profile.
- No external network request.
- No Xianyu WebSocket.
- No WeCom integration.
- No AI Provider.
- No prompt generation.
- No browser automation.
- No API or Web UI.
- No database table or Migration.
- No Repository, Service, Worker, Scheduler Job, or background process.
- No dependency addition.
- No capability binding.
- No implementation before explicit approval.

## Security boundary

- Use Synthetic Fixtures only.
- Do not commit or log real customer messages, personal information, credentials, or Secret Material.
- Do not send a message.
- Do not infer permission, authorization, risk, or platform behavior.
- Do not bypass platform verification or risk controls.
- Do not generate a reply when authorization, ownership, rule match, content safety, or risk state is uncertain.
- Fail closed on ambiguous, conflicting, missing, or unsupported input.

## Approval boundary

Moving CHG-0005 beyond DRAFT requires separate explicit project-owner authorization.

Draft preparation does not authorize T1, Runtime implementation, Capability binding, Ready for review, Auto-merge, or Merge.
