# XIANYU

XIANYU is the long-lived repository for a future Xianyu operations automation system. The current repository state contains governance, specifications, validation scripts, tests, and CI only. It does not provide real Xianyu publishing, message receiving, message sending, automated reply, WeCom, AI Provider, FastAPI, database business logic, WebSocket, Playwright, or scheduled publishing capability.

## Project goal

The final intended business path is:

1. Product templates.
2. Immediate or scheduled Xianyu listing.
3. Receive customer inquiries from Xianyu.
4. Reply with fixed scripts.
5. Guide customers to WeCom customer service.
6. Send website links through WeCom.
7. Use AI only as fallback for questions not covered by fixed knowledge.
8. Transfer sensitive issues to human support.

## Current phase

The current phase is repository baseline only:

- Governance and fact-source rules.
- Scope, architecture, capability, ADR, and contract placeholders.
- Context, state generation, validation, duplicate capability detection, and security scan scripts.
- Unit, contract, acceptance tests, and GitHub CI.

## Technical direction

The locked architecture direction is modular-monolith Core, one worker per Xianyu account, one Chrome Profile per account, and replaceable AI Provider. This baseline records the direction only and does not implement it.

The first phase does not introduce Redis, Celery, MySQL, PostgreSQL, React, n8n, OpenClaw runtime, vector databases, LangChain complex agents, Kubernetes, or multi-tenancy.

## Repository fact sources

Read these paths as the fact source, in order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `specs/PROJECT_SCOPE.md`
3. `specs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. `specs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.yaml`
5. `changes/active/`中动态发现的唯一活动变更目录 (the uniquely dynamically discovered active change directory)
6. `docs/adr/`
7. `contracts/`
8. `generated/PROJECT_STATE.json`
9. `tests/`

Do not manually edit `generated/PROJECT_STATE.json`; generate it with `python scripts/generate_state.py`.

## Local setup

Recommended Python version: 3.12 or newer.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/Scripts/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Context command

```bash
python scripts/project_context.py
```

## Verification commands

```bash
python scripts/verify_repository.py
pytest
ruff check .
mypy scripts app
```

## Development flow

1. Create one branch per approved change from `main`.
2. Run `python scripts/project_context.py` before development.
3. Search existing specs, ADRs, scripts, and tests before adding anything.
4. Complete only the next unfinished task.
5. Update the active change task list only after the work is actually complete.
6. Run unified verification before commit.
7. Create one commit and open a PR.

## Current capability statement

This repository currently contains no real business capability. It cannot log in to Xianyu, publish listings, receive messages, send messages, call WeCom, call AI, run FastAPI routes, create business database tables, install browsers, or access real accounts.
